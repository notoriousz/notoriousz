## Be Welcome!! ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Matheus Serafim, but you can call me _Mah_

#### A bit of me ðŸ‘‡
Iâ€™m 22 years old, currently working as Analyst at @Loggi, and I study Business Administration at SÃ£o Paulo Federal Institute (IFSP). However, I've been learning programming by myself for a year, and I wish to follow the Software Engineer Career. As a hobby, I like to eat a variety of foods, play with my little dog and travel.
